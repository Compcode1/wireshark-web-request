    "Analyze and document the complete packet sequence of a single web request, from DNS resolution to TCP/TLS handshake to data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå Expected Outcome:\n",
    "By the end of this project, you'll have a packet-level breakdown of how a web request is processed, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS resolution (finding the IP address of the website).\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP handshake (establishing a connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS handshake (if using HTTPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP request and response (or encrypted payload if HTTPS).\n",

    "**Step 1: Start Wireshark and Configure Capture**\n",
    "‚úÖ Open Wireshark on your system.\n",
    "‚úÖ Select the correct network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).\n",
    "‚úÖ Set up a capture filter to focus only on the web request:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Generate a Controlled Web Request**\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Open a terminal and run one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a standard request:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "curl -v https://example.com\n",
    "(Verbose mode will show detailed request steps.)\n",
    "\n",
    "o ensure we capture a clean, isolated web request, we will use the cURL command in the terminal instead of a browser. This provides a controlled request without extra network noise from ads, JavaScript, or background browser processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use cURL?\n",
    "It only sends a single request‚Äîno extra traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output shows each stage of the request, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS resolution (finding the IP of the website).\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP handshake (establishing a connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS handshake (if HTTPS is used).\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP request and response (server reply).\n",
    "\n",

    "This DNS response confirms that weightlifting.com resolves to an IPv4 address, completing the query-response process. Now, your computer can proceed to connect to 199.59.243.228.  This DNS response confirms that weightlifting.com resolves to an IPv4 address (199.59.243.228), allowing the computer to establish a connection. However, we now see that the system also sent a separate DNS query for an IPv6 address (AAAA record) immediately after the initial IPv4 query. This behavior is normal and expected‚Äîmodern operating systems and browsers commonly request both IPv4 (A record) and IPv6 (AAAA record) to determine which is available and preferred. The goal is to use IPv6 if possible but fall back to IPv4 if no IPv6 address exists or if the network does not support it. Whether the system ultimately connects over IPv6 depends on whether the DNS response contains a valid IPv6 address and whether the system's network supports IPv6 connectivity. By analyzing the IPv6 response (Packet #15), we will determine if weightlifting.com supports IPv6 or if the connection defaults to IPv4. "

    "üìå Why is the IPv4 Header Checksum \"Unverified\" in Wireshark?\n",
    "‚úî The checksum (0xA4CC) is computed by the sender (your system), NOT Wireshark.\n",
    "‚úî Wireshark does not always verify IPv4 checksums because modern network adapters and operating systems offload checksum calculations to hardware (NICs).\n",
    "‚úî Since your network interface card (NIC) handles checksum validation, Wireshark may mark it as unverified because it doesn't manually recompute it.\n",
    "‚úî If checksum validation is disabled in Wireshark‚Äôs settings, it will always display \"unverified.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå Does This Mean the Packet is Corrupt?\n",
    "No! A packet marked \"unverified\" does NOT mean the checksum is wrong‚Äîit just means Wireshark didn't verify it. If the checksum were truly incorrect, Wireshark would flag it as \"bad\" or \"checksum error.\"\n",
